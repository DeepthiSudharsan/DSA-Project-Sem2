## DATA STRUCTURES PROJECT ON LINKED LISTS AND SPARSE MATRICES

### SPARSE MATRIX AND SPARSE VECTOR USING LINKED LIST
### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create Sparse matrix and Sparse vectors using linked lists. A matrix stores data with 2 indices row and column (r,c). Suppose the matrix is big, say 5000 x 5000 but only 100 values in it are non zeros, then such matrices with most of their values as zeros, are called sparse matrices. We need a list that finds the row and another that identifies a column, where the data is.
